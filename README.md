# About

This is a python3 application that will take in data from different input sources, process them into a common format, then output (draw) 
them to custom screens (HUD or efis style).  The system is created to have the inputs and screens seperate and non-dependent of each other.  
For example a user running a MGL iEFIS can run the same screen as a user with a Dynon D100.  Issues can come up with a input source does not 
have all the data available as other input sources do.  But if the screen is written well enough it will hide or show data if it's available.


## Currently supports:

MGL iEFIS

Garmin G3x

Dynon Skyview

Dynon D10/100

Levil BOM (wifi)

Stratux or any stratux compatiable device (wifi)

Generic serial logger (Used for recording any serial data)


We are using the rapberry pi 4B for taking serial data from a EFIS (MGL,Dynon,G3x) and displaying a graphical Display out the hdmi output on the pi.  This is plugged into a Display or HUD device like the Hudly Classic.  Any sort of HDMI screen could be hooked to the Pi for displaying this flight data.

Code is written in Python 3.7 and the Pygame 2.0 module for handling the graphics.

You can run this code in either raspbian full or lite.

Raspbian full install contains the xwindow desktop system.  The lite version does not.
This supports both versions.

## Analog CDI from IFR Navigator

  TronView supports reading CDI and VDI data from an IFR Navigator for use on EFIS systems that do not output this data over RS-232. This is done via the ADS 1115 Analog to Digital Converting I2C chip from Texas Instruments. The ADS 1115 is available on a carrier board from Adafruit to make connecting to it more convenient with a Pi.

  This interface enables a "crosshair" style presentation of CDI data on the defaul and F18 hud pages, plus any page you may come up with. This essentially creates the ability for one to fly an ILS or GPS/LPV approach using TronView, though since TronView is NOT a certified instrument nor is it intended in any way to be used as primary instrumentation.

  In order to wire this up, you'll need an IFR navigator (GPS or NAV radio) that supports the output of +L/+R and +U/+D signals. Examples of radios that do this include the Garmin GNS, GTN and 2-inch GPS Navigator series, Garmin GNC 255/215, SL-30, Avidyne IFD and King KX 165 (NOT 155) units. There are certainly more that will do this, but these are the most popular examples.

  This hookup uses the same wiring as most mechanical CDIs.

  The ADC has 4 input channels, labeled 0-3. Channel 0 is CDI +L, Channel 1 is CDI +R, Channel 2 is VDI +U, and Channel 3 is VDI +D. Refer to your navgiator's installation manual/pinout to determine the matching pins. 

  We recommend installing an intermediate D-Sub connector for both diagnostics and future changes.



## Steps to get the software running on raspberry pi

1) WIFI and autologin. You’ll want to get the pi on your wifi network so it can download the latest source.  Here are some instructions online that might help.  https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md

To setup auto login. (so you don't have to login to pi every time it boots up)

Enter the command `sudo raspi-config` Scroll down to Boot Options and select Console Autologin. Then exit the configuration menu and reboot.

2) Install git command.   This will let you get the latest source from github directly onto the pi.

`sudo apt-get -y install git`

3) clone the source from github

`git clone https://github.com/flyonspeed/TronView.git`

this will ask for username/email password from github.

when done this will create a TronView dir

4) run the setup.sh script to finish install.  This will setup serial port (if not allready setup), and install python libraries needed.

go into the TronView by typing

`cd TronView/util`

then to run the script type

`./setup.sh`

5) reboot the device.  type

`reboot`

6) Test the hud/efis screen with existing example data.  
run the following.  First make sure you are in the efis_hud dir.

`cd TronView`

Then run the python script and use the example data for dynon d100.

`sudo python main.py -i serial_d100 -e`

You should see a basic hud on the screen.  And it slowy moving around.  
If not then your video setup maybe be F'd up.  

To exit you hit "q" on the keyboard.


7a) Next if you want to run live serial data from your efis.
run the serial_read.py script to confirm data being sent is correct.
go into TronView dir then type

`cd TronView`

`sudo python util/serial_read.py`

you will have to pass in -m or -s for mgl or skyview data.

make sure the data is coming through and looks good.

to exit hit cntrl-c

7b) run it

Note:  You have to run using sudo in order to get access to serial port.

Example:

`sudo python3 main.py -i serial_mgl -e`

will show you command line arguments.

`-i {input data source 1}` 

load a input module for where to get the air data from. 

--in1 {input source 1} (same as -i)

--in2 {input source 2} 

-s (optional) {screen module name to load} (located in the lib/screens folder)

-t (optional) start up in text mode

-e (optional) demo mode. load default example demo data for input source selected.

-c FILENAME (optional) custom playback file. Enter filename of custom example demo file to use.

--playfile1 (optional) same as -c.. set playback file for input 1

--playfile2 (optional) set playback file for input 2

--listlogs (optional) show logs you saved. location id defined in config.cfg

--listusblogs (optional) show logs saved to usb drive (if available)

--listexamplelogs (optional) show example log files to playback


Run the command with no arguments and it will show you which input modules and screen modules are available to use.

`sudo python3 main.py`

## Examples command line arguments

To set Input1 to garmin g3x and Input2 to stratux wifi and run default example data run the following.

`sudo python3 main.py --in1 serial_g3x --in2 stratux_wifi -e`


To run Input1 to MGL and Input2 as stratux.  then supply custom example log files...  Note that these custom log files are in the example data dir.  This will also check the DataRecorder path dir that you set in the config file. 

`python3 main.py --in1 serial_mgl --playfile1 mgl_1.dat --in2 stratux_wifi --playfile2 startux_1.dat`


Lauch app in text mode playing dynon D100 example data. Press 'Q' to exit Text Mode.

`python3 main.py --in1 serial_d100 -t -e`

## DefaultScreen

The default screen has the following keyboard commands.

current commands are:

q - quit

t - switch to text mode  ( can not switch back to graphic mode after you enter text mode )

p - pause/unpause play back of log file (only if you are playing back a log file)

cntrl right arrow - fast forward play back file.

cntrl left arrow - rewind play back file (currently doesn't really work great)

cntrl d - show some debug info (same as using the number 7 key)

1 - create flight data log file

2 - close flight data log file

3 - cylce through traffic scope modes and ranges (if traffic input source available)

4 - drop target buoy at current location and altitude.  Will be visiable on traffic scope

5 - drop target buoy exactly 1 mile ahead of aircraft heading.

6 - clear all target buoys.

7 - cycle through debug modes (in graphic mode)

9 - show gun target in F-18 HUD screen.

PAGE UP - jump to next screen

PAGE DOWN - go to previous screen

To run with


## Creating your own custom screen file

Screen files are located in lib/screens folder.  For a quick start you can duplicate the DefaultScreen.py file and rename it to your own.  What ever name you give it you must name the Class in that file to the same name.  For exmaple if I create MyHud.py then in that file I must set the class to the following

`class MyHud(Screen):`


Functions for custom screens:

### initDisplay(self,pygamescreen,width,height):

this is called once on screen init and tells your class the screen width and height

### draw(self,aircraft):

draw() is called in the main draw loop.  And the current aircraft object is passed in with all current postion values.

### clearScreen(self):

each time the screen is drawn it first has to clear it.  this is called to do that.

### processEvent(self,event):

handles events like key presses.

## Creating your own Input source module

Input sources are located in lib/inputs folder.  Create your own!  You can use existing modules as examples for how to do this.


## Screen resolution for hudly


1.        Type “sudo raspi-config”
2.        Select "Advanced options"
3.        Select A5 – Resolution  (Screen)  -> Select “CEA Mode 3  720x480  60 Hz  16:9”
6.        Select “OK”
7.        Select:  "Finish"
8.        Select:  "Yes"
9.        Wait for the reboot



## config.cfg

config.cfg can be created and sit in the same dir as the main.py python app.  It's used for configuring the hud.  View config_example.cfg for a example of options.

by using the config file you don't need to pass in so many arguments to the command line.

Here is a example config.cfg file:

https://github.com/flyonspeed/TronView/blob/master/config_example.cfg

# Demo Sample EFIS Data

  Demo data is saved in lib/inputs/_example_data .  Demo data lets you run previously recorded data through the hud app for demo or testing purposes.  Each input source module uses it's own format for data.  So for example if you want to run dynon demo data then you must run it through the dynon input source module.
  
  Using the -c FILENAME command line option loads data from the _example_data folder.
  
  Example to run the MGL_2.dat demo data file would look like this:
  
  `sudo python3 main.py --in1 serial_mgl --playfile1 MGL_2.dat`

  Note this is setting up input1.
